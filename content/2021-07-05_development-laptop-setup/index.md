A high productivity means that activities are not creating value a reduced to a minimum. One of those activities which can't be avoided but doesn't create value is the setup of a new development machine. This blog post explains a concept how a developer how starts in a new project can get productive in under one hour.

As example the [K.S.C.H. Workflows](#) project is being used which is a prototype for a custom software for the [Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital](#).

## Tools

- Java
- Dart
- Flutter

## Configuration

### SSH key

The SSH key is a secret which should be copied from a private backup or newly generated.

### Editor shortcuts

Editor shortcuts are customizations for the editors. This is a very personal thing which doesn't make much sense to be tracked on project-level. However, the project should encourage to use editor configuration which is under version control.


## Backup

### Source code

All programs and scripts should be under version control using Git and GitHub or something similar.

### Notes

For privacy reasons it's best to use and external hard drive for the backup of personal notes.

## Evolving the setup

The process needs to be tested with each new version of the operating system.

When there is a problem, create an issue in the GitHub repository.

Commit changes to editor snippets and keymaps to version control.
