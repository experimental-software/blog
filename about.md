Experimental Software is an imaginary software development company for educational purposes.

The name can have two different meanings:

1. A professional company which builds world-class products with [Lean Experimentation](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_promise_of_lean_experimentation).
2. Some random, weird name because all the good ones are already claimed by other companies ([cylon.com](http://cylon.com/), [leanx.eu](https://www.leanx.eu), [effective-software.com](https://www.effective-software.com), etc.); used for alpha versions of new products.
